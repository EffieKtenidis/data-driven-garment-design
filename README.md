# Data-Driven Garment Design  

This project explores the intersection of computational signal processing and fashion design.  
Using Python-based audio analysis, I transformed sound waveforms into 2D geometric patterns. These patterns were then incorporated into the design of a custom skirt.

## Project Overview

1. **Audio Processing**  
   Using Python, `librosa`, and `NumPy`, I analyzed recorded audio and applied FFT to extract dominant harmonics.

2. **Waveform Reconstruction**  
   I reconstructed a simplified time-domain signal using the strongest harmonic components.

3. **Geometric Pattern Generation**  
   The reconstructed waveforms were exported as 2D curves and used as the basis for the skirt’s pattern design.

4. **Garment Construction**  
   The final skirt was drafted, patterned, and sewn using these computationally generated shapes.
